Hello There!

This is my Kodi (XBMC) Addon repository! Here I host addons that I have made or modified for Kodi, or
that I have been asked to host. Each addon probably has it's own repository, with the exception 
of the repository addon itself, as my belief is that one should not have to clone all of the 
addons to only modify a single one. This git repository just serves as a collection of the 
packages.

Usage
-----
Simply download the repository zip and install it, or use Kodi's repository installer plugin.
